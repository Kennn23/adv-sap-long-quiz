## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural approach used in software design and development. It involves creating applications by using services available in a network.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Reusability: Services in an SOA are designed to be reusable components that can be used in various applications and contexts. This reusability reduces development time and promotes consistency across different parts of a system. 
- Discoverability: It is the service that is constantly emphasized which is the key to communication between the provider and consumer.

3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is an architectural style for developing software applications as a collection of small, independently deployable, and loosely coupled services.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Scalability: They go beyond microservices being a popular architectural style for new applications and the cloud being popular hosting destination for new applications. Microservices are likely to be atleast as popular with executives and project leaders as with developers. Microservices have better reflect the way many business leaders want to structure and run their teams and development processes.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
SIMILARITIES Both SOA and microservices are service based architectures. They both loose coupling between services. Both SOA and microservices emphasizes the importance of interoperability 

DIFFERENCE SOA was an enterprise effort to standardize the way all services talk and to integrate with each other while microservices architecture is application specific. The SOA has an enterprise scope while microservices architecture has an application scope

6. Define Web Services.
- It is a piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and it uses standardized messaging system.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
Low Cost Communication 
-It uses SOAP to use your existing low cost internet implementing web services.

Interoperability
-they use standardized protocols like XML,JSON,SOAP to have compatibility and interoperability.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
XML-Based
-it uses XML at data representation and data transportation layers. Using XML eliminates any networking, operating system or platform binding.

Loosely Coupled
-The consumer of web service is not tied to that web service directly.  The services are independent of each other, allowing changes in one service without affecting the others, as long as the interface remains unchanged.


9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
Provider
-Web Services Architecture is a provider that creates web service and makes available to client applications who wants to use it.

Broker
-It handles tasks like routing requests, protocol translation, message transformation or enforcing security policies.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
SOAP - an XML based language for desribing web services and how to access them.
- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.
- it is a communication protocol that communicates between applications.
- It can run any operating system.

WDSL - an XML based language for describing, publishing and finding web services.
- WDSL stands for Web Services Description Language.
- it navigates for individuals and other businesses to access the service.
